## MacOS Configuration
All configuration for macOS systems is found here.

This includes configuration for applications like `git`, `zsh`, `vim`, and `tmux`.

## Layout
```
.
├── config             # Config files not written in Nix
├── cachix             # Defines cachix, a global cache for builds
├── default.nix        # Defines how we import overlays 
├── files.nix          # Non-Nix, static configuration files (now immutable!)
├── home-manager.nix   # The goods; most all shared config lives here
├── packages.nix       # List of packages to share

```
